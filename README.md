# NativeGarden - React Native Project
This is a React Native school project that uses the [Skia](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/) graphics engine to render a growing garden of plants.

## Usage
The plants are randomly generated and grow over time. You can water and cut them by tapping and swiping.
